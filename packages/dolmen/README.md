# Dolmen

Dolmen is a themeable UI component library designed to work with Solid.js and optimized for SSR
(Server-side rendering). It provides a broad selection of UI components with minimal overhead.

## Themes

Themes are implemented using CSS variables. Once a theme has been defined, you can add the
theme's class name to any element, and it will affect all descendants of that element.

Multiple themes are supported, so you can have (for example) a sidebar with a different color
scheme than the main page.
