Icons in this folder are taken from freely-licensed sources.
They have been modified (manually) to change the fill color to the CSS variable --icon-color.

The build:svg script converts these icons to Solid components, allowing the SVG to be inlined
into the HTML. This is generally more efficient (bandwidth-wise) than using icon fonts or
image urls.
