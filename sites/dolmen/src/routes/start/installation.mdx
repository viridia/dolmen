import { Table, Group, Stack, Button } from 'dolmen';
import { ShellExample, SourceCode, PropsTable, PropsItem, UnionType } from '../../components/mdx';

# Installation

To add Dolmen to your project, add the `dolmen` package using your preferred package manager.

<ShellExample>
&gt; npm install dolmen
</ShellExample>

Next, you'll need to import the Dolmen stylesheets into your app. If you want to import all
of the Dolmen styles, using the following import command:

<SourceCode>
```tsx
import 'dolmen/css/styles.css';
```
</SourceCode>

Alternatively, if you want to minimize the CSS bundle size, you can import just the styles you
actually need, based on which components you are using. You'll need to import the "common" styles,
along with the stylesheet for each component type:

<SourceCode>
```tsx
import 'dolmen/css/common.css';
import 'dolmen/css/components/Button.css';
import 'dolmen/css/components/Modal.css';
import 'dolmen/css/components/Page.css';
import 'dolmen/css/components/Slider.css';
```
</SourceCode>

You will also need to import at least one theme. Dolmen comes with two built-in themes,
which are a light theme and a dark theme.

<SourceCode>
```tsx
import 'dolmen/css/theme/light.css';
import 'dolmen/css/theme/dark.css';
```
</SourceCode>

To activate a theme, add it's class name to the root of your app. Which element you put it
on doesn't really matter so long as that element surrounds all of the Dolmen components:

<SourceCode>
```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body class="dm-theme-light">
    <div id="main" />
  </body>
</html>
```
</SourceCode>

At this point, you can now use the Dolmen components in your Solid.js app:

<SourceCode>
```tsx
import { Button, Group } from 'dolmen';
import { VoidComponent } from 'solid-js';

const App: VoidComponent = () => {
  <Group gap="xl">
    <Button>Make</Button>
    <Button>It</Button>
    <Button>So!</Button>
  </Group>
}
```
</SourceCode>
