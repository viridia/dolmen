# Overview

Dolmen is a UI component library written using [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/). It is designed
to work well with either client-side or server-side rendering (SSR).

Dolmen's design philosophy emphasizes minimalism rather than trying to provide every imaginable
feature. At the same time, because Dolmen is based on CSS standard features like CSS layers,
it is relatively easy to extend and override it's capabilities.
