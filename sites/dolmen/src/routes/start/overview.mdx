# Overview

Dolmen is a UI component library written using [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/). It is designed
to work well with either client-side or server-side rendering (SSR).

Dolmen's design philosophy emphasizes minimalism rather than trying to provide every imaginable
feature. At the same time, because Dolmen is based on CSS standard features like CSS layers,
it is relatively easy to extend and override it's capabilities.

## About the name

A "dolmen" is a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb. Thus, it is both a work of art, as
well as being very, very **solid**.

Plus, the npm package name wasn't already taken. So there.
