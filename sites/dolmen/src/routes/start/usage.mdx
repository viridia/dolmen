# Usage

Dolmen doesn't require any globally scoped styles or context providers. However, there are
a couple of items that you may want to initialize at the top level of your application:

* If you are using toasts, you will want to install a `ToastFrame`.
* If you are using tooltips, you may want to install a
  <A href="../../hooks/createTooltipWatcher">tooltip watcher</A>.

## Page layout

If your app has a relatively standard layout, with a title bar and a scrolling body, you can
use the `Page` component to define your overall layout.

<SourceCode>
```tsx
<Page>
  <Page.Header>
    <Page.Title>
      Page Header
    </Page.Title>
  </Page.Header>
  <Page.Content>
    Page content
  </Page.Content>
</Page>
```
</SourceCode>

## Theme selection

A lot of sites offer the choice of a "dark mode" or "light mode" theme selector. Dolmen doesn't
provide this out of the box, because the implementation will be different depending on how you
want to persist user settings. However, such a feature is relatively easy to add.

If you are using Dolmen in an SSR context, where you are doing both client-side and server-side
rendering, then you will need to store the user's preference somewhere that is accessible on both
the client and the server. The obvious way to do this is with a cookie. The cookie value is read by
both the client and the server code, but it's only written on the client, in response to the user
clicking on the theme mode button.

Once you have the cookie value, you can use it select either the light or dark theme by adding
the appropriate CSS class name to the top level of your app. If you are using solid-start, then
your top level might look something like this:

<SourceCode>
```tsx
<Body
  classList={{
    [userSettings.theme === 'dark' ? 'dm-theme-dark' : 'dm-theme-light']: true,
  }}
>
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <Suspense>
      <Routes>
        <FileRoutes />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>
  </ErrorBoundary>
  <Scripts />
</Body>
```
</SourceCode>
