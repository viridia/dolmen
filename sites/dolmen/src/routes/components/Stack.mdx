# Stack

A `Stack` is a layout component which arranges its children vertically. (Basically it's
a flexbox with flex-direction set to `column`).

<DemoSection>
  <Stack gap="xl">
    <Button>Buffy</Button>
    <Button>Angel</Button>
    <Button>Xander</Button>
    <Button>Willow</Button>
  </Stack>
</DemoSection>
<SourceCode>
```tsx
<Stack gap="xl">
  <Button>Buffy</Button>
  <Button>Angel</Button>
  <Button>Xander</Button>
  <Button>Willow</Button>
</Stack>
```
</SourceCode>

### Properties

The `Stack` component has no special properties of its own. However, like all layout components,
it accepts both the standard Dolmen 'flex props' properies as well as the standard HTML element
properties.
