# Alert

An alert is used to notify the user of important changes or conditions in the application.
Use this if you need to communicate to users in a prominent way.

Alerts should not be used to display form validation errors. Instead use the `FormField`
component to display an error associated with a specific input field. Alerts *can* be used,
once a form has been submitted, to display an error that pertains to the entire form, or at
least is not tied to any specific field.

<DemoSection>
  <Stack gap="lg">
    <Alert severity="success">Hey, it actually worked!</Alert>
    <Alert severity="info">Just so you know...</Alert>
    <Alert severity="warning">I've got a bad feeling about this...</Alert>
    <Alert severity="error">Meeee-Maaaaw! Meeee-Maaaaw! Meeee-Maaaaw!</Alert>
    <Alert severity="success" when={false}>
      This should not be visible.
    </Alert>
  </Stack>
</DemoSection>
<SourceCode>
```tsx
<>
  <Alert severity="success">Hey, it actually worked!</Alert>
  <Alert severity="info">Just so you know...</Alert>
  <Alert severity="warning">I've got a bad feeling about this...</Alert>
  <Alert severity="error">Meeee-Maaaaw! Meeee-Maaaaw! Meeee-Maaaaw!</Alert>
  <Alert severity="success" when={false}>
    This should not be visible.
  </Alert>
</>
```
</SourceCode>

The `when={condition}` property can be used to prevent the alert from being shown. Since alerts are
often displayed conditionally, depending on whether there is a current error condition, this
removes the need to surround the alert with an extra layer of conditional logic.

## Alert properties

Checkboxes accept all of the standard properties for an HTML checkbox element. The only additional
attribute is the "indeterminate" option:

<PropsTable>
  <PropsItem
    name="severity"
    description="Indicates the severity (and thus, the color scheme) of the alert."
    type={
      <ul>
        <li><code>success</code></li>
        <li><code>info</code></li>
        <li><code>warning</code></li>
        <li><code>error</code></li>
      </ul>
    }
  />
  <PropsItem
    name="when"
    description="An optional property which can be used to conditionally hide the alert. If not present, the alert will always be shown."
    type="boolean"
  />
</PropsTable>
