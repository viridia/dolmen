# RadioButton

"Radio Buttons" represent a mutually exclusive set of options - only one option within the
set can be chosen at a time.

<DemoSection>
  <Stack gap="md">
    <RadioButton name="state" value="solid">Solid</RadioButton>
    <RadioButton name="state" value="liquid">Liquid</RadioButton>
    <RadioButton name="state" value="gas">Gas</RadioButton>
  </Stack>
</DemoSection>
<SourceCode>
```tsx
<RadioButton name="state" value="solid">Solid</RadioButton>
<RadioButton name="state" value="liquid">Liquid</RadioButton>
<RadioButton name="state" value="gas">Gas</RadioButton>
```
</SourceCode>

## Handling mutual exclusion

Radio buttons are meant to be part of a group, such that at most one element of the group can
be in the 'checked' state. Setting any radio button to checked causes all other buttons in the
group to become unchecked. (It is possible to be in a state where none are checked.)

There are two ways to handle this, depending on whether the radio buttons are controlled or
uncontrolled.

For uncontrolled radio buttons, the built-in browser behavior can be used: all of the radio
buttons within a given group should have the same `name` property, but different `value` properties.
(The `name` property represents the field name that would be submitted as part of a form).
The browser will then handle exclusion automatically. This works even if the buttons are not
inside a form.

For controlled radio buttons, it will typically be the case that each radio button represents
a specific option or value, and the `checked` property set to true only if the currently selected
value (which is presumably reactive) matches the value associated with that button.

**Note**: Even for controlled buttons, it's recommended to set the `name` and `value` properties as
you would for uncontrolled buttons. This will cause the browser to handle keyboard navigation in a
way that conforms to accessibility best practices: arrow keys navigate within the group, and the
TAB and shift-TAB keys navigate between groups.

## RadioButton properties

Checkboxes accept all of the standard properties for an HTML radio input element.
