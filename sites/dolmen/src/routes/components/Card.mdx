# Card

A `Card` displays a section of content.

<DemoSection>
  <Card>
    <Card.Content>
      This is a card
    </Card.Content>
  </Card>
</DemoSection>
<SourceCode>
```tsx
<Card>
  <Card.Content>
    This is a card
  </Card.Content>
</Card>
```
</SourceCode>

The `Card` component by itself has no padding. This means you can insert a divider that extends
all the way to the edge of the card.

To get the correct padding, use the `Card.Content` component inside the card.

### Properties

The `Card` and `Card.Content` components have no special properties of their own. However, like all
layout components, they accept both the standard Dolmen <A href="../../start/flex">flex props</A>
as well as the standard HTML element properties.
