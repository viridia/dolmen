# EmptyResult

The `EmptyResult` component is used to display a message indicating that a 'null' result
was returned. A 'null' result could be the result of a search or query that returned zero
records. It can also be used to describe a non-serious error or empty state. (Serious errors
should use a more prominent message such as an `Alert`).

As a general rule, any UI that can display a variable number of results (zero or more) should
display an `EmptyResult` when there is no data to display, instead of displaying nothing.

<DemoSection>
  <EmptyResult>No records found</EmptyResult>
</DemoSection>
<SourceCode>
```tsx
<EmptyResult>No records found</EmptyResult>
```
</SourceCode>

## Properties

`EmptyResult` has no special properties, it acts like a <HTMLTag>div</HTMLTag> element.
