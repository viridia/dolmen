# SplitPane

`SplitPane` creates a split panel with multiple draggable dividers.

The number of splits is one less than the number of child elements. Each child element is separated
by a splitter bar.

<DemoSection>
  <PageOutline style={{ 'flex-direction': 'row', height: '15rem' }}>
    <SplitPane direction="horizontal">
      <div>First Child</div><div>Second Child</div><div>Third Child</div>
    </SplitPane>
  </PageOutline>
</DemoSection>
<SourceCode>
```tsx
<SplitPane direction="horizontal">
  <div>First Child</div>
  <div>Second Child</div>
  <div>Third Child</div>
</SplitPane>
```
</SourceCode>

Split panes can also split vertically. (Direction can be somewhat confusing: "vertical" refers to
the direction in which the children are arranged, not the orientation of the splitter bar.)

<DemoSection>
  <PageOutline style={{ 'flex-direction': 'row', height: '15rem' }}>
    <SplitPane direction="vertical">
      <div>First Child</div><div>Second Child</div>
    </SplitPane>
  </PageOutline>
</DemoSection>
<SourceCode>
```tsx
<SplitPane direction="vertical">
  <div>First Child</div>
  <div>Second Child</div>
</SplitPane>
```
</SourceCode>

### Properties

<PropsTable>
  <PropsItem
    name="direction"
    description="Direction of the split."
    type={
      <UnionType values={['horizontal', 'vertical']} />
    }
  />
</PropsTable>

## SplitPane.Controlled

The normal `SplitPane` component is uncontrolled, meaning that the split positions are kept
internal to the component and are not externally accessible.

Sometimes, you may want more control over the split positions. For example, you might want
to be able to initialize the default split widths so that some panels are larger than others.
You may also want to persist the split positions in local storage so that they are preserved
across page reloads.

For this, you can use the controlled variant `SplitPane.Controlled`. It accepts an array of
numbers representing split positions. Each entry represents a proportion (from 0..1) of
where the corresponding split bar should be placed. So for example, if there are 4 children
and you want to give them equal widths, then the `positions` property would be `[.25, .5, .75]`.

### Properties

<PropsTable>
  <PropsItem
    name="direction"
    description="Direction of the split."
    type={
      <UnionType values={['horizontal', 'vertical']} />
    }
  />
  <PropsItem
    name="positions"
    description="Array of split positions."
    type="number[]"
  />
  <PropsItem
    name="setPositions"
    description="Function which is called when positions are dragged."
    type="(positions: number[]) => void"
  />
</PropsTable>
