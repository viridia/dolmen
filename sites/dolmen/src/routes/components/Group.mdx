# Group

A `Group` is a layout component which arranges its children horizontally. (Basically it's
a flexbox with flex-direction set to `row`).

<DemoSection>
  <Group gap="xl">
    <Button>Groucho</Button>
    <Button>Chico</Button>
    <Button>Harpo</Button>
    <Button>Zeppo</Button>
  </Group>
</DemoSection>
<SourceCode>
```tsx
<Group gap="xl">
  <Button>Groucho</Button>
  <Button>Chico</Button>
  <Button>Harpo</Button>
  <Button>Zeppo</Button>
</Group>
```
</SourceCode>

### Properties

The `Group` component has no special properties of its own. However, like all layout components,
it accepts both the standard Dolmen 'flex props' properies as well as the standard HTML element
properties.
