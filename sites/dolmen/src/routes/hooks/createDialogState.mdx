# createDialogState()

The `createDialogState()` hooks is a wrapper around `createCssTransition()` that can be used
for managing the state of a `Modal.Dialog`.

In most cases, you won't need this, as the top-level `Modal` component already contains this
functionality. However, there may be cases where you want more precise control over the
opening and closing animation.

The hook takes a single parameter which is an options object:

<SourceCode>
```tsx
interface IDialogStateOptions {
  /** Duration of the dialog opening animation, in milliseconds. */
  delay?: number;

  /** Duration of the dialog closing animation, in milliseconds. */
  exitDelay?: number;

  /** Callback which is called when the dialog is fully closed, that is when the closing
      animation has completed. */
  onExited?: () => void;
}
```
</SourceCode>

The hook returns an object with the following properties:

<SourceCode>
```tsx
interface IDialogState {
  /** Reactive signal if the dialog is 'visible'. This will be true if the dialog is open,
      or if the dialog's closing animation is not finished. */
  visible: boolean;

  /** Accessor which returns true if the dialog is open. */
  open: Accessor<boolean>;

  /** Setter which controls the open/closed state of the dialog. Changing the value of this property
      will trigger the dialog's opening or closing animation. */
  setOpen: Setter<boolean>;

  /** A set of properties to spread into the Modal.Dialog component. */
  modalProps: {
    state: CssTransitionState;
    onClose: () => void;
  };
}
```
</SourceCode>

Typical usage:

<SourceCode>
```tsx
const dialogState = createDialogState();

return (
  <>
    <Button onClick={() => { dialogState.setOpen(true); }}>Open</Button>
    <Modal.Dialog {...dialogState.modalProps}>
      <Modal.Body>Dialog Content</Modal.Dialog>
      <Modal.Footer>
        <Button onClick={() => { dialogState.setOpen(false); }}>Close</Button>
      </Modal.Footer>
    </Modal.Dialog>
  </>
)

```
</SourceCode>
