# createCssTransition()

The `createCssTransition()` hook creates a small state machine that can be used to drive
simple CSS animations. The state transition can be used for a variety of animated components,
such as modal dialog open/close, popup menus, toast enter and exit and so on. Simple CSS
transitions typically won't work for these kinds of components, because the DOM doesn't
exist when the component is closed, so there is nothing to transition *from*.

The `createCssTransition()` hook does not do any animation itself, it simply produces a
time-sequence of class names which can then be used to drive a CSS transition or animation. The
hook guarantees that there will be at least one frame where the 'outgoing' state is present
before transitioning to the 'incoming' state. So for example, when opening a modal dialog,
there will be one frame where the class name will be `enter-start` before transitioning to
`entering` and finally `entered`. This ensures that the CSS transitions driven by that class
name will work as expected.

<SourceCode>
```tsx
const [entered, setEntered] = createSignal(false);
const state = createCssTransition({ in: entered, delay: 500 });

return (
  <Stack>
    <div>state="{state()}"</div>
    <CheckBox checked={entered()} onChange={() => setEntered(prev => !prev)}>In</CheckBox>
  </Stack>
);
```
</SourceCode>

The function takes a single argument, a parameter object with the following properties:

* **in** is the only required parameter. It is a reactive function that produces a boolean,
  and determines whether the animation state machine should transition to an "entered" or "exited"
  state.
* **delay** specifies, in milliseconds, the duration of transition. The same delay is used
  for both enter and exit transition, unless the `exitDelay` property is present.
* **exitDelay** allows the exit animation duration to be specified separately from the enter
  animation.
* **onExited** is a callback which is called when the exit animation has completed. This can
  be used to clean up any resources, or to remove elements from the DOM that are no longer
  needed.

The return value of the function is a reactive state function, which returns one of the following
values:

  `enter-start` | `entering` | `entered` | `exit-start` | `exiting` | `exited`

The initial state is either `enter-start` or `exit-start`, depending on the initial value of `in`.

When `in` changes from false to true, state will transition to `enter-start` for one animation
frame. This immediately transitions to `entering`, which lasts for `delay` milliseconds. After that,
the state changes to `entered` and stays there for as long as `in` remains true.

A similar transition occurs when `in` changes from true to false, cycling from
`exit-start` --> `exiting` --> `exited`.
