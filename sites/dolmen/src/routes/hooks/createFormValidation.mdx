# createFormValidation()

The `createFormValidation()` hook creates a basic reactive form validator.

Demo (try hitting 'save' without typing anything in the input fields).

<DemoSection>
  <FormValidationDemo />
</DemoSection>
<SourceCode>
```tsx
const { errors, formProps } = createFormValidation<{
  channelName: string;
  description: string;
}>({
  channelName: {
    required: (data: string) => data.length > 0,
  },
});

return (
  <form {...formProps}>
    <Stack gap="xl">
      <FormField title="Channel Name" error={getErrorMessage(errors.channelName)}>
        <Input name="channelName" max={24} autofocus />
      </FormField>
      <FormField title="Channel Description">
        <TextArea name="description" />
      </FormField>
      <Group gap="md" justifyContent="end">
        <Button type="button">Cancel</Button>
        <Button color="primary" type="submit">
          Save
        </Button>
      </Group>
    </Stack>
  </form>
);
```
</SourceCode>

## Design Principles

The `createFormValidation()` hook has as specific design philosophy. In fact, part of the motivation
for creating this hook is that there are so many validators out there that don't support these
design principles:

* **No replacment of the `Form` component.** Many form validation libraries work by supplying their
  own `Form` component. This won't work with [solid-start](https://start.solidjs.com/) and other
  frameworks which also supply a custom form. Instead, `createFormValidation()` overrides
  the `onSubmit` event handler, so you can use whatever form component you like.
* **The application, not the library, should be responsible for localization of error messages.**
  Some validation libraries provide a limited support for localization: they have a preset
  collection of error messages, and these messages have been translated into a fixed set of
  languages. This creates several problems:
    * Some applications support over 200 languages, others may only support a dozen languages or
      fewer. It is important that the form validator support the same set of languages as the
      application, which is impossible for an open-source library to manage.
    * The fixed set of error messages cannot encompass every possible error, so it is always
      going to be the case where some error messages are application-specific.
* **Error messages should only be generated after an error occurs.** Many validators require the
  app to supply the set of all possible error messages up-front, before validation begins.
  This makes it impossible for error messages to contain dynamic fields. It's also inefficient
  if the error messages are being looked up from a translation catalog.
* **The validator should return error codes, not error messages.** Many validators try to make
  life simpler for the developer by returning error messages; this is a mistake. It should be
  up to the application to translate the error code into the appropriate localized string. One
  reason is that this allows the application to supply additional context information to help
  the user recover from the error.
  * A common example of bad UI is a generic error message like "too short", when it should be
    something more like "Username must be at least 3 characters".

## Recovery Mode

The recommended practice for form handling UI requires that a form validator have two "modes": the
initial mode does *not* validate as the user is typing, as this would be a distraction. Once the
user attempts to submit the form, however, if there are any validation errors then these errors are
displayed, and the validator goes into "recovery mode". In this mode, validation occurs
continuously as the user is typing.

## Parameters

The `createFormValidation()` hook is a generic function which takes a single type argument:
the type of the form data. This should be an object that has one field definition for each
field that is to be validated, where the field key is the same as the input field's `name`
property. The type of the field should be the same as the `value` attribute of the HTML element
for that field.

The function takes two parameters:

* **schema** - this is the validation schema. It should be an object whose keys are the names
  of the fields to be validated, and whose values are validators (see next section).
* **onSubmit** - this is an optional callback which will be called when the form is submitted,
  but only if there were no validation errors.

### Writing validators

Validators can be written in two ways. The first is simply a function that returns an error
code, or returns null if the validation was successful:

<SourceCode>
```tsx
const { errors, formProps } = createFormValidation<{
  username: string;
}>({
  username: (value) => value.length > 0 ? null : 'required',
});
```
</SourceCode>

The other way to write a validator is an object with one key per error code. The values of
this object are functions which each return a boolean. A `true` result means validation was
successful. A false result means that validation failed, and the corresponding error code is
applied to the field's validation status.

<SourceCode>
```tsx
const { errors, formProps } = createFormValidation<{
  username: string;
}>({
  username: {
    required: (data: string) => data.length > 0,
    tooLong: (data: string) => data.length < 64,
  },
});
```
</SourceCode>

### Return values

The return value from `createFormValidation()` is an object with the following fields:

* **formProps** - An object containing properties which should be spread into the form element.
* **errors** - A reactive object containing all of the validation errors. The keys of this
  object are the input field names, and the value is an error code.
* **recovery** - A boolean which indicates whether we are in recovery mode. While in recovery
  mode, validation is performed as the user types.
* **setRecovery(enabled: boolean)** - A function which allows you to force recovery mode on or off.
* **validate()** - A function which can be used to instantly trigger a validation.

### Use with schema validation libraries

There are many JavaScript schema validation libraries such as Yup, Zod and so on. It is possible
to use these libraries as validators for `createFormValidation()`. However, some care must be
taken when using these packages:

* Schema validators tend to generate readable messages rather than error codes. This is a problem
  for localization - it's unlikely that the validator library supports the same set of locales
  as your application.
* Similarly, the messages produced by these validation libraries tend to be very generic, which
  may confuse the user.
* Also, many of these libraries support regex patterns for validation. The problem with using regex
  patterns is that these patterns often test for multiple kinds of failure, and there's no way to
  explain to the user what they did wrong. Most users don't know regular expressions, and so
  simply saying "input did not match pattern" is not helpful.
  * One way to overcome this is to use multiple patterns, where each pattern only tests for
    a single type of mistake ("no special characters", etc.)

The best way to use schema validator libraries is to override their built-in error messages with
your app's own error codes, and then to look up those error codes in your app's translation
catalogs. These messages can be context-specific, that is, the messages are authored for a specific
form and contain advice that is pertinent to that form.
