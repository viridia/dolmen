# createFocusTrap()

The `createFocusTrap()` prevents TAB and Shift-TAB keys from moving the keyboard focus outside
of a specified container element. This is used by modal dialogs and other modal components.

The hook implements 'wraparound' behavior, so for example if the focus is set to the last
focusable field within the dialog, pressing TAB will move focus to the first focusable field.

Typical usage:

<SourceCode>
```tsx
const { focusProps } = createFocusTrap();

return (
  <dialog
    {...focusProps}
    role="dialog"
    open
  />
);
```
</SourceCode>

The function takes a single argument, which is an options object. There is currently only one
option:

* **onKeyDown** - a callback used to handle keyboard events. The focus trap listens for keyboard
  events, specifically the tab key. Any keys that it doesn't recognize are forwarded through
  this callback. So for example if you wanted to listen for the escape key and close the dialog,
  you could use this callback.

The return result of the hook is a set of attributes to be forwarded to the container element.
